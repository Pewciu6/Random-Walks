Random walk ( sometimes called as drunkard's walk ) is a process where our person is walking randomly, this person creates a path consisting of random steps in some kind of space (N,E,S,W) . Calculating the probability is extremely hard using just math and we, humans tend to not understand statistics so I decided to visualise it a bit to make it a bit easier to grasp.
